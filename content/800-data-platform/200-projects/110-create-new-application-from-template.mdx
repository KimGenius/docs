If you want to explore how to create projects in the Prisma Data Platform, you can start with a template Prisma schema which is immediately migrated to an empty database.

## Prerequisites and considerations

* GitHub account
* [Sign up for the Prisma Data Platform](/data-platform/accounts#sign-up-for-the-prisma-data-platform)
* Connection string to a [Prisma ORM-supported database](/reference/database-reference/supported-databases)
* [Grant the Prisma GitHub app read and write permissions to your GitHub repositories](/data-platform/projects#grant-read-and-write-permissions-to-the-prisma-github-app)

## Steps

1. Go to the [_Projects_](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page and click **New Project**.
2. On the _Configure project_ page, name your project and create a new GitHub repository.
    1. In the **Display Name** text box, enter a name for your project.

        **Note**<br /><br />
        The display name of a project appears in several places in the Prisma Data Platform.<br />
          &nbsp;• [_Projects_](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page<br />
          &nbsp;• [_Billing_](https://cloud.prisma.io/billing) page<br />
          &nbsp;• **Projects** drop-down in the upper-left
        </Admonition>

        **Note**<br /><br />

        • The GitHub repository name is pre-filled based on the display name and each space is replaced with a hyphen.<br /><br />
        • The GitHub repository name cannot duplicate other repository names.<br />

    5. Click **Next**.

        />
3. On the _Select template_ page, select an application template for your first project.
    1. Select one of the available application templates and preview its Prisma schema file below.
        * **Blog**. Schema for a blog built with Next.js.
        * **Music Streaming Service**. Schema for a fictional music streaming service with a REST API.
        * **Rentals Platform**. Schema for a fictional hotel with a REST API.
        * **SaaS**. Schema for an identity service with a SaaS with a REST API.
        * **URL Shortener**. Schema for a URL shortener with a REST API.
        * **Empty**. An empty schema with no models, to build your own schema.
    2. (Optional) Deselect the **Include sample data** check box to skip seeding the database with sample data.

            width="750px"
        />
    3. Click **Next**.
4. On the _Configure environment_ page, connect your database and configure the Data Proxy location.
    1. In the **Connection string** text box, paste your database connection string.
        <Admonition type="alert">

        **Important**<br /><br />
        If you provide a connection string to a non-empty database (with existing tables and data), the project creation fails.
        </Admonition>
    2. Under _Data Proxy_, from the **Location** drop-down menu, select the geographic location for the Data Proxy.
        <Admonition>
        
        **Note**<br /><br />
        Select a Data Proxy location that is close to the geographic location of your database.<br /><br />
        If you select a different location, when your application sends requests to your database through the Data Proxy, the responses might be slow or might time out due to higher latency.
        </Admonition>
    3. From the **Static IPs** drop-down menu, select **Enabled** if your database is behind a firewall and you can only configure external access from specific IP addresses. Copy the IP addresses and add them to the allowlist of your database.
        <Admonition>

        **Note**<br /><br />
        For more information, see [Static egress IP address](/data-platform/static-ips).

    4. Click **Next**.

        alt="Prisma Data Platform - Manage project members - Step 03 - Click Edit for the project member you want to delete"
        width="750px"
        />
5. On the _Deploy project_ page, you can deploy your project to Vercel, save your connection strings and environment variables.
6. Click **Done**.
        
## Result

The Data Browser opens with a list of the models (tables or collections) that exist in the database based on the application template you selected.
