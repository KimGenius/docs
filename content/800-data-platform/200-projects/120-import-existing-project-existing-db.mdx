## Prerequisites and considerations

* GitHub account
* GitHub repository with your Node.js application that uses Prisma ORM
* Connection string to a [Prisma ORM-supported databases](/reference/database-reference/supported-databases)
* [Sign up for the Prisma Data Platform](/data-platform/accounts#sign-up-for-the-prisma-data-platform)
* [Grant the Prisma GitHub app read and write permissions to your GitHub repositories](/data-platform/projects#grant-read-and-write-permissions-to-the-prisma-github-app)

## Steps

1. Go to the [_Projects_](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page and click **New Project**.
2. On the _Configure project_ page, name your project and select an existing GitHub repository.
    1. In the **Display Name** text box, provide a name for your project.

        **Note**<br /><br />
        The display name of a project appears in several places in the Prisma Data Platform.<br />
          &nbsp;• [_Projects_](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page<br />
          &nbsp;• [_Billing_](https://cloud.prisma.io/billing) page<br />
          &nbsp;• **Projects** drop-down in the upper-left

    2. From the **GitHub Accounts & Organizations** drop-down menu, select a GitHub account or an organization.
    3. Select the **Import a Prisma repository** option.
    4. From the **Repository** drop-down menu, select the GitHub repository you want to import.
    5. From the **Branch** drop-down menu, select the branch you want to import.
    6. In the Prisma Schema path, check that the import wizard detects the path of the `schema.prisma` file correctly.
    7. Click **Next**.

3. On the _Configure environment_ page, connect your database and configure the Data Proxy location.
    1. In the **Connection string** text box, paste your database connection string.
    2. Under _Data Proxy_, from the **Location** drop-down menu, select the geographic location for the Data Proxy.
        <Admonition>
        
        **Note**<br /><br />
        Select a Data Proxy location that is close to the geographic location of your database.<br /><br />
        If you select a different location, when your application sends requests to your database through the Data Proxy, the responses might be slow or might time out due to higher latency.
        </Admonition>
    3. From the **Static IPs** drop-down menu, select **Enabled** if your database is behind a firewall and you can only configure external access from specific IP addresses. Copy the IP addresses and add them to the allowlist of your database.
        <Admonition>

        **Note**<br /><br />
        For more information, see [Static egress IP address](/data-platform/static-ips).
