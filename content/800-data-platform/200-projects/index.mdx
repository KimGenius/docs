When you create or add a new project in the Prisma Data Platform, you must define a database connection string for your application, a GitHub repository where your application is stored, and a geographic region for the Data Proxy so that it is closer to region of your database.

In the Prisma Data Platform, you can add a project with one of the three supported workflows.

1. [Create a new database application from a template](#create-a-new-project-with-a-new-repository-and-a-new-database)
    * **Database**: provide a connection string to an empty database
    * **GitHub repository**: create a new GitHub repository
    * **Use case**: Explore project creation and start with template Prisma schema which is immediately migrated to the empty database.
2. [Import an existing application with an existing databases](#import-an-existing-project-with-an-existing-repository-and-database)
    * **Database**: provide a connection string to an existing database
    * **GitHub repository**: select an existing GitHub repository
    * **Use case**: Import your production application and configure the Data Proxy to enable connection pooling and prevent exhausted database connections in serverless environments.
3. [Import an existing application with a new database]()
    * **Database**: provide a connection string to an empty database
    * **GitHub repository**: select an existing GitHub repository
    * **Use case**: Import your application and use an empty database to explore and test project creation and the features in the Prisma Data Platform.

You can also edit your project settings (name and URL) and delete your project if you no longer need it.

* [Edit project settings](/data-platform/projects/edit-settings)
* [Delete a project](/data-platform/projects/delete-project)

## Prerequisites and considerations

* [Sign up for the Prisma Data Platform](data-platform/create-manage-projects#sign-up-for-the-prisma-data-platform)
* [Grant read and write permissions to your GitHub repositories](/data-platform/create-manage-projects#grant-read-and-write-permissions-to-the-prisma-github-app)

### Sign up for the Prisma Data Platform

To create projects in the Prisma Data Platform, you must sign up first. For more information see [Sign up for the Prisma Data Platform](/data-platform/accounts#sign-up-for-the-prisma-data-platform).

### Grant read and write permissions to the Prisma GitHub app

When you sign up for the Prisma Data Platform, you must grant access to the Prisma GitHub app so that it can read data about your GitHub profile and use that to log you in to the platform.

In addition, you must also grant read and write permissions to the GitHub app so that it can read and create new repositories.

**Steps**

1. After you [sign up](/data-platform/accounts#sign-up-for-the-prisma-data-platform), go to the [_Projects_](https://cloud.prisma.io/projects) page.
2. Click **New Project**.
2. Click the **GitHub Accounts & Organizations** drop-down menu.
3. If you do not see any GitHub accounts or organizations in the drop-down, select **+ Add an Organization or Account**.

4. On the new browser tab that opens, click **Install** to grant permissions to the Prisma GitHub app read and write permissions to your repositories.

    **Note**<br /><br />
    The Prisma Data Platform requires read and write permissions to GitHub repositories to read your Prisma schema file and to create new repositories for new projects.

    </Admonition>

**Result**

The Prisma GitHub app now has the required permissions to read the Prisma schema from the repositories you add for your projects in the Prisma Data Platform.

In addition, the granted permissions make it easy to create a new repository for brand new projects in the platform.

You can see that the Prisma GitHub application is installed in your profile settings.

1. Select your GitHub profile menu and select **Settings**. 
2. Select **Applications** under **Integrations**.
