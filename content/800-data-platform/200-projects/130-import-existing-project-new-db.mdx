Import your application and use an empty database to explore and test project creation and the features in the Prisma Data Platform.

You can use the steps provided in [Import an existing project with an existing database](/data-platform/create-and-manage-projects/import-existing-project-existing-db) to import a project.

At step 4.1., in which you provide the database connection string, make sure to provide a connection string to an empty database.

The project creation uses the Prisma schema from the GitHub repository to migrate the current schema.
